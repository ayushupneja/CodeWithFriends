# User stories
Ayush loves to code. However, as a social person, he finds coding by himself to be very lonely. Ayush wants to be able to interact/socialize with his friends while writing code. He would like to be able to work collaboratively in one notepad on the same piece of code as his friend to solve coding challenges together. He would also like to be able to compete in coding games against his friend where he can earn points or race his friend.
